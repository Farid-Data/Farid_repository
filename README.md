Mastering Python, pandas, and data visualization

Deep-diving into machine learning and SQL

Building end-to-end data science projects to sharpen my skills

ðŸš€ My passions

Exploring how AI can transform industries

Creating clean, insightful dashboards that tell a story with data

Teaching and sharing knowledge â€” Iâ€™ve also been an English teacher for 2 years, which taught me the value of clarity and communication
