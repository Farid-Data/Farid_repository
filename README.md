## Hey, Iâ€™m Farid ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m passionate about **data science, machine learning, and AI** â€” basically anything that involves turning raw data into something meaningful. For me, itâ€™s not just about writing code, itâ€™s about **finding patterns, solving problems, and telling stories with data**.

### ðŸ”­ What Iâ€™m working on right now

* Building hands-on projects with **Python, pandas, and SQL**
* Getting deeper into **machine learning** techniques and experimenting with models
* Learning to design **clean, insightful dashboards** that actually make sense to people who arenâ€™t data scientists
* Sharpening my knowledge of **statistics, visualization, and modeling** to bring everything together

### ðŸŽ¯ What drives me

I believe **data is more than numbers** â€” itâ€™s a way to understand people, systems, and decisions. What excites me most is how data science can impact real-life problems, from predicting outcomes to optimizing processes.

Teaching English for two years gave me a skill that really helps in tech: the ability to **break down complex ideas into simple explanations**. I try to bring that same mindset when I work on projects or collaborate with others.

### ðŸŒ± Always learning

Iâ€™m big on **self-growth and self-awareness**. For me, coding and data science arenâ€™t just technical skills â€” theyâ€™re also tools for creativity and problem-solving. Every project I build is both practice and a chance to push myself further.

### âš¡ A bit more about me

* Background in **Computer Engineering**
* Completed the **IBM Data Science Certificate**
* Actively preparing to step into the **data science field in the US**
* Believe that **learning by doing** is the fastest way to grow
* Outside of coding, Iâ€™m constantly exploring ideas, reflecting, and trying to level up as a person
